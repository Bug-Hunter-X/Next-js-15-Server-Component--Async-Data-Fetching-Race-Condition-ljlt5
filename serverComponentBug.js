In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with a specific combination of features:  client-side data fetching within a server component that depends on data fetched within the same server component.  The error manifests as an unexpected `undefined` value being passed to a React component. This issue stems from the asynchronous nature of `fetch` and the timing of how server components render. The `fetch` call within the server component might not complete before the component attempts to use its results, particularly if the `fetch` relies on data already fetched within the same server component.
